# GovCheck (Contract Checker) - Phase 1

> SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later

## Overview

GovCheck Phase 1 is a **laptop-deployable application** designed to validate NSF PAPPG compliance for research proposals. The system uses AI-powered analysis to ensure proposals meet federal funding requirements before submission.

**Note:** This is Phase 1 of the larger OBI-One platform. For comprehensive end-state specifications and the full platform architecture, see the [obi-one repository](https://github.com/yourusername/obi-one).

## Quick Start
